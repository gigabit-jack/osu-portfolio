# 📘 **Oregon State University Portfolio --- Josh Goben**

Welcome to my software engineering portfolio!

I decided in 2022 to start the Computer Science postbaccalaureate program at Oregon State University. This repository contains selected projects completed during my coursework at Oregon State University.

Each project represents a major assignment, multi-week build, or final portfolio piece demonstrating full-stack development, algorithms, data structures, assembly programming, and software engineering practices.

This repository will be updated as I continue my development journey at OSU. One day, I will make that final commit after the program is complete.

## 📄 **How This Portfolio Is Organized**

Each folder in the root of this repository represents a major project, one per class.
Inside each folder, you'll find:

- Complete source code
- README.md (when provided by the assignment)
- Supporting assets (SQL files, views, assets, etc.)
- Full commit history preserved from the original class repos (please don't judge my bad commit messages, they've gotten better over time!)

This structure allows employers and collaborators to explore representative work directly.

## 🙋‍♂️ **About Me**

I'm an American expat living in New Zealand, and while I've been in IT for over 13 years now, I'm working toward a career shift to software engineering.

I enjoy web development, data engineering, automation, and full-stack application design. I found Assembly to be much more entertaining than I expected, and I love the concept and design of APIs. Front-end work is just alright. Next up are .NET and C#, though my future courses may not involve those so that may be personal work.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to build useful tools, and can't wait to call myself a "real" developer!
